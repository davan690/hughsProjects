Date,Date of observation
Pass,"Generally, 2 passes were done for each date"
Tag,Tag ID number or fish ID number
Lon,Longitudinal position within study reach
,Ranges from roughly -30 ? ~250
,Indicates metres upstream from a designated starting point
,This is the position of the fish at the time of the observation
Lat,Latitudinal position within the stream
,Centimetres from the left bank (while looking upstream)
,Not generally recorded for times when tag is recorded
,"Points collected at 20cm spacings from the left hand bank, so min(lat) = 20 and max(lat) I think goes up to about 200 or more, not above (I don’t think)"
Depth,Water depth (cm)
Flow,Water velocity (m/s)
,Substrate proportions – how much of each substrate was present within a 10cm radius around each point.
,Sum(BR:Silt) should equal 100 (100%)
,"Substrate particle sizes refelective of the “Wentworth Scale” (see geology textbooks) Boulder is the largest, Silt is the smallest, bedrock is just bedrock"

,Bedrock
,Boulder
BR,Cobble
B,Pebble
C,Gravel
P,Sand
G,Silt
S,
Silt,
,"Other habitat features present or absent at each point (1 = present, 0 = absent)"
Rip,Overhanging ‘riparian’ vegetation
Aqu,Aquatic veg / in-stream macrophytes
Und,Undercut banks
leaf,Leaf litter/debris in-stream
Comment,"Random comments – was the fish found dead, other stuff"
