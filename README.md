# hughsProjects
This file is defined as the `README.md` file and on a `github` account as long as the file is called exactly as above it will automatically be added as the rendered `html` file when users open the `github` repository like as above.

## Week one

![1566965493373](resources/hugh-data.png)

![1566967229323](resources/download.png)

Or fork it from your `github` account if you have already got one

![1566967274706](resources/fork.png)

You need the following packages (I have probably forgotten some:

- `bookdown`

- `tidyverse`

- `ggplot2`

## Key questions

The first week will take the basic dataset above to address the following key questions:

##### Do fish prefer to use areas with high proportions of certain substrates? 

- We may expect fish prefer areas of larger substrates (boulder, cobble), and less of small substrates (silt, sand)?

##### Do fish prefer some of the other habitat variables (rip, aqu, und, leaf)?

- We may expect fish like these habitat features as they provide cover from predators etc

##### Do fish prefer areas of fast/slow water, and likewise deep/shallow water?

- Also, depth may be related to velocity, which may be related to dominant substrate type (higher velocity = larger substrate particles)

- Or, do fish just use the available habitat in the proportions that it is available?

#### The data is a little more complex:

The first few rows are where fish were released (batch-released at a few locations)

#### And a bit more:

Then, when fish are located habitat variables are recorded (initially only for pass 1, but later for both passes 1 and 2)

This readme can function as the home-page of a project site in `github` using `github` pages being published form the docs folder

##### Or, habitat variables are recorded in the ‘available’ locations
